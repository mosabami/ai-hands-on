# Become an AI Researcher

This repository provides a structured, hands-on path to becoming an AI researcher. It includes Jupyter notebooks covering the mathematical foundations, PyTorch fundamentals, and building neural networks from first principles.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Math Fundamentals (`1.Math/`)
- Math functions, derivatives, vectors, and gradients
- Matrix operations and linear algebra
- Probability and statistics

### 2. PyTorch Basics (`2.Pytorch/`)
- Creating and manipulating tensors
- Matrix multiplication, transposing, and reshaping
- Indexing, slicing, and concatenating tensors
- Special tensor creation functions

### 3. Neural Networks (`3.Neural-Network(NN)/`)
- Building neurons, layers, and networks from scratch
- Normalization techniques (RMSNorm)
- Activation functions
- Optimizers (Adam, Muon) and learning rate decay

### 4. Transformers (`4.Transformer/`)
- Attention and self-attention mechanisms
- Multi-head attention
- Decoder-only transformer architecture

### 5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (`5.RAG/`)
- Building RAG pipelines end to end
- Indexing, retrieval, chunking strategies
- Integrations with embedding models and vector stores

### 6. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) (`6.OCR/`)
- OCR pipeline and utilities
- Preprocessing images and extracting text

## Learning Path

For a recommended step-by-step progression through the materials, see the Learning Path:

- `Start_here/learning_path.md`

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Recommended workflow:

1. Open Jupyter in the project root:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Work through notebooks in order:
   - `1.Math/`
   - `2.PyTorch/`
   - `3.Neural-Networks/`
   - `4.Transformer/`

3. Folder to run separately:
   - `5.RAG/`
   - `6.OCR/`
