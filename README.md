A complete, hands-on guide to becoming an AI Engineer.

This repository is designed to help you learn AI from first principles, build real neural networks, and understand modern LLM systems end-to-end.
You'll progress through math, PyTorch, deep learning, transformers, RAG, and OCR — with clean, intuitive Jupyter notebooks guiding you at every step.

Whether you're a beginner or an engineer levelling up, this repo gives you the clarity, structure, and intuition needed to build real AI systems.

## Books

Recommended reading to deepen your understanding (not included):

- `AI Engineering` by Chip Huyen
- `Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow` by Aurélien Géron
- `Deep Learning` by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville
- `The Elements of Statistical Learning` by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman
- `Neural Networks and Deep Learning` by Michael Nielsen
- `SQL Cookbook` by Anthony Molinaro

For more books in AI/ML, I have created another repo for this. [Check Here](https://github.com/Ramakm/AI-ML-Book-References.git). I will be adding lot more in coming days/months. If you are interested to read book, go check this repo out.

## Learning Path

For a recommended step-by-step progression through the materials, see the Learning Path:

- `Start_here/learning_path.md`

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some subfolders (for example `5.RAG/` and `6.OCR/`) include their own `requirements.txt` with additional dependencies.

## Usage

Recommended workflow:

1. Open Jupyter in the project root:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   # or
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Work through notebooks in order:
   - `1.Math/`
   - `2.PyTorch/`
   - `3.Neural-Network(NN)/`
   - `4.Transformer/`

3. Folder to run separately:
   - `5.RAG/`
   - `6.OCR/`
  
4. Resources
5. Basic ML Model Implementation (Supervised + Un-supervised + RL)
   - `1.Linear Regression`
   - `2.Logistic Regression`
   - `3.Decision Tree Model`
   - `4.Naive Bayes Classification`

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Please ensure:

- Notebooks are clean (Restart & Run All before committing)
- Existing structure & naming conventions are followed
- PRs are focused, readable, and documented
- In folders like RAG and OCR, please maintain the cleaned structure part
- If you want to add something new folders, make it proper structure way.
